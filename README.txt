This project is not production quality, and has no working automagic installer, but all required components
for a working solution should be there.

Description:
A server-side logging solution for IIS7+ with a web-frontend for easy access to the information.

Dependencies:
* .NET 3.5 (for logging component)
* ASP.NET MVC 2 and .NET 4 (for web-component)
* IIS7
* SQL Server 2005 or newer. Express will do, but not sure I'd recommend it.

This is basically my first attempt to use git & github with Windows and Visual Studio and the quality
and orderlyness of things will be reflective of just that.
